          We live in a world where we need to move quickly and iterate on our
          ideas as flexibly as possible. Building mockups strikes the ideal
          balance between true-life representation of the end product and ease
          of modification.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mockups are useful both for the creative phase of the project - for
          instance when you&lsquo;re trying to figure out your user flows or the
          proper visual hierarchy - and the production phase when they will
          represent the target product. Making mockups a part of your creative
          and development process allows you to quickly and easily ideate.
